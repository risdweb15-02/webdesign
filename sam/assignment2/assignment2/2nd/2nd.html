        Michael Amzalag was born in 1968 and grew up in Paris. He studied at the Ecole Nationale Superieure des Arts Decoratifs (ENSAD) between 1986 and 1990, and left before graduating to work for the music magazine Les Inrockuptibles. In 1992 he founded M/M (Paris) with his former ENSAD schoolmate Mathias Augustyniak.<br><br>

M/M (Paris) have developed collaborations across cultural fields such as music, fashion, art, magazines, film, design, architecture, and theatre and, more recently, have started their own publishing imprint.

Amzalag and Augustyniak conceive their projects as a sustained body of work. They understand their practice to be a production of a series of signs, images as signifying entities, which they are constantly reordering to build their own language.<br><br>

Rejecting the traditional graphic design service-providing model, they encourage a productive relationship with their commissioners to inspire experiences, nurturing a number of long-term relationships, notably with musicians Bjork and Benjamin Biolay, the Theatre de Lorient, fashion designers Nicolas Ghesquiere and Yohji Yamamoto, photographers Inez van Lamsweerde & Vinoodh Matadin and artists Pierre Huyghe and Philippe Parreno.<br><br>

M/M’s works are featured in the collections of instiutions such as the Centre Pompidou, Musee National d’Art moderne, Paris; Design Musuem, London; Museum of Contemporary Art, Miami; Museum fur Moderne Kunst, Frankfurtl; Museum fur Gestaltung, Zurich; Musee d’Art moderne de la Ville de Paris, Paris; Stedelijk Museum, Amsterdam; Tate Modern, London; and Van Abbemuseum, Eindhoven.<br><br>
