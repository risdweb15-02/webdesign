            <a href="4th/4th.html"><p>M/M’s most longstanding fashion relationship to date has been with Yohji Yamamoto. Between 1995 and 2000, they created a series of catalogues for the Japanese designer that can be read as a single loosely structured fantasy. The starting point of this story was a publication that emphasised Yamamoto’s celebrated association with austere monochromatic garments. Shot by David Sims in 1995, it shows Stella Tennant in a series of elegantly gauche poses attired in signature Yamamoto pieces and accessorised with enigmatic geometric props. This tale was developed over subsequent catalogues. In particular the props evolved to become, in the case of the Fall/Winter 1998/1999 catalogue shot by Ines Van Lamsweerde and Vinoodh Matadin, almost threatening. Where Stella Tennant clutches mute black disks and steps through purposeless archways, Maggie Rizer appears to use a collection of unyielding and perspectivally odd furniture as the setting for a supernatural rite.<br>

The M/M/Yamamoto formula mellowed over the years. In the last of the catalogues, Fall/Winter 2000/2001 shot by Craig McDean, Amber Valetta wraps herself in gently padded robes and obscures her celebrated features with flimsy paper masks. Unmistakably part of the same story, this chapter offers a postscript ending, the kind of conclusion that implies a review of the entire episode through older, wiser eyes. M/M marked the end of their collaboration with Yohji Yamamoto with a publication titled Rewind/Forward. Intercutting catalogues one with another, this small book encouraged a non-seasonal take on fashion, a view that is an anathema to an industry that is founded on six-monthly fresh starts.</p></a>
