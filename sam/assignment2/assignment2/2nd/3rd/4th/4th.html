            <a href="5th/5th.html"><p>Biophilia also happened to be designed by several masters of interaction design, from the aforementioned Scott Snibbe—a major figure in the field whose pioneering work has influenced the youngest generation of artists and designers—to the other great artists that designed the 10 song/apps (and whose names are listed in the caption above). Among them is Max Weisel, who was part of the MoMA exhibition Talk to Me: Design and the Communication between People and Objects in 2011. The “mother app”—the galaxy—was conceived by Björk and Mathias Augustyniak and Michael Amzalag of M/M Paris, the artist’s longtime design collaborators.</p></a>
