			Interview with Massimo Vignelli.
			</p>
		</div>

		<div id="container"><p class="body">Massimo Vignelli was one of the few designers I had not personally met prior to our interview, and as a result, I approached the date of our meeting with a certain amount of nervousness. It didn’t help that this was also the only interview wherein I inadvertently stood my subject up. That’s right — I mistakenly scribbled down our mutually agreed upon meeting time in the wrong box of my crude, paper calendar and missed the meeting entirely. In fact, it wasn’t until many hours later that I even realized that I kept Massimo waiting for my arrival. Fortunately for me, he took it in stride, even going so far as graciously suggesting it was better that we didn’t meet that day, as something came up that he need take care of while he waited for me to show up.</p>

		<p class="body">This alone highlights Massimo’s incredible spirit, his joie de vivre, his humor and his generosity. Universally considered one of the great design practitioners of our time, Massimo is also kind. He is a true gentleman. Not content with anything less than elegant, Massimo is erudite, exceedingly well mannered, charming, cute even. Yes, I said it: Massimo Vignelli is cute. He is also remarkably forgiving. When he left a message alerting me of our missed meeting, he also reassured me it was quite all right, and requested we reschedule. Despite my nerves, our subsequent meeting was delightful and we spent many hours talking about love, his wife and partner Leila Vignelli, the staying power of the American Airlines logo, vulgarity, his penchant for the color black and the typeface Bodoni, his protégé Michael Bierut, the friendship he had with Alan Fletcher, the perfect sofa and over fifty years in the business of design.</p>

			<p class="questionDM"><span class="DM">Debbie Millman:</span>
			How important, if at all, is writing to your work?</p>

			<br><p class="questionMV"><span class="MV">Massimo Vignelli:</span>
			Well, I write all the time. Of course, my English is limited and my writing follows my English. But somehow the writing is better; at least there is less of an accent! I am a maniac about being semantically correct. I find that when I write, I automatically look for the perfect word more often than I do when I speak. I want to have the exact word that says exactly what I mean as precisely as possible.</p>

		<p class="questionDM2"><span class="DM">DM:</span> Why did you choose to live in New York?</p>
		<br><p class="questionMV2"><span class="MV">MV:</span>
			It’s a long story. The quick answer is that we started the company with some friends here in the U.S., and we opened an office in New York. The person who was supposed to run the office got sick. I was in Milan at the time and I was commuting back and forth. I got tired of flying over twice a month, and so we [Vignelli and his wife, Leila] decided to come over and run the office for a while and then go back. We’re still here after 40 years. [Laughs.] We’re still here. New York is a fabulous city. It’s like a magnet. I can’t leave anymore. There is nothing that can compare to New York. And it is not even beautiful. There are hundreds, thousands of other cities that are much more beautiful. But there is only one New York.</p>

	<div>
		<p class="questionDM3"><span class="DM">DM:</span>What do you think contributes to making it so special?</p>
		<br><p class="questionMV3"><span class="MV">MV:</span>
			It’s the energy. It’s the way people walk, it’s the way people talk. It’s the way people live. You know: In New York, people dress in black all the time.</p>
	</div>
<div>
		<p class="questionDM4"><span class="DM">DM:</span>So when did you make the decision in your life that you wanted to be a designer?</p>
		<br><p class="questionMV4"><span class="MV">MV:</span>
			When I was 14 years old, extremely early in my life.</p>
	</div>
	<div>
		<p class="questionDM5"><span class="DM">DM:</span>What happened?</p>
		<br><p class="questionMV5"><span class="MV">MV:</span>
			 I went to a house of a friend of mine, and his mother had just finished redecorating. And all of sudden, I discovered that somebody was responsible for doing these kinds of things. Nothing happened by itself. That fascinated me. I went home and started to design. I read books and magazines about these things so I became more educated. And I got more and more involved, so that by the time I was 18, I knew exactly what I wanted to do.

<div>
		<p class="questionDM6"><span class="DM">DM:</span>What do you think is the difference between a literary mind and a visual mind?</p>
		<br><p class="questionMV6"><span class="MV">MV:</span>
			 A visual mind is interested in anything that you see, and a literary mind is interested in anything you think. A literary mind is interested in people. A visual mind is interested in things, objects, nature. This doesn’t mean that you look and don’t think. Of course, you do that, too. But a literary mind is more prone to thinking than looking visually. They like to read. They like to analyze things from a psychological point of view. Writers like this write about isolation, and some write about being together. Each one investigates one action of the mind. And the mind, being as complex as it is, is an endless source of investigation.</p>

<div>
		<p class="questionDM7"><span class="DM">DM:</span>Do you feel your work is immediately identifiable as your work? Do you feel you have a style?</p>
		<br><p class="questionMV7"><span class="MV">MV:</span>
			 Yes and no. After many years of exposure, in some ways it is. My work has a certain discipline, a rigor, and a minimalist expression. I use a very limited choice of colors. [Laughs.] Primarily black and red. To me, black is black and red is color. That’s it. </p>
	</div>
<div>
		<p class="questionDM8"><span class="DM">DM:</span>And what about your preference for Bodoni?</p>
		<br><p class="questionMV8"><span class="MV">MV:</span>
			 Bodoni is one of the most elegant typefaces ever designed. When I talk about elegance, I mean intellectual elegance. Elegance of the mind. </p>
	</div>

<div>
		<p class="questionDM9"><span class="DM">DM:</span>How would you define elegance of the mind?</p>
		<br><p class="questionMV9"><span class="MV">MV:</span>
			 I would define intellectual elegance as a mind that is continually refining itself with education and knowledge. Intellectual elegance is the opposite of intellectual vulgarity. We all know vulgarity very well. Elegance is the opposite. 
 </p>

<div>
		<p class="questionDM10"><span class="DM">DM:</span>I have to ask: What would you consider to be vulgar?</p>
		<br><p class="questionMV10"><span class="MV">MV:</span>Vulgarity is something underneath culture and education. Anything that is not refined. There are manifestations of primitive cultures or ethnic cultures that could be extremely refined and elegant, but don’t belong to our kind of refinery or culture. Culture is the accumulation of at least 10,000. You can really say that intellectual elegance is the by-product of refinement. One of the greatest things about vulgarity is that it tends to continuously disappear.<br><br>

		My friend Umberto Eco wrote a book about beauty, and now he’s writing a book about ugliness. He told me the last time I saw him that it was much more difficult to write a book about ugliness than to write one about beauty. It’s the same with vulgarity, in a sense.

		<p class="questionDM11"><span class="DM">DM:</span>What do you think design is really about?</p>
		<br><p class="questionMV11"><span class="MV">MV:</span> Number one, design is a profession that takes care of everything around us. Politicians take care of the nation and fix things — at least they are supposed to. Architects take care of buildings. Designers take care of everything around us. Everything that is around us, this table, this chair, this lamp, this pen has been designed. All of these things, everything has been designed by somebody.<br><br>

I think that it is my responsibility to make the work better than it is. That is my number one priority. The second priority is to decrease the amount of vulgarity around by replacing the vulgarity with things that are more refined.<br><br>

When we work with clients, we make it quite clear from the beginning that we don’t intend to create vulgar things. Most of the time we don’t even have to say this; when a client comes in, they know what we are doing, and they want us to do things for them in this way. So we don’t have too much to fight over! But even in the client discussions, they can see that this is what we want to do. 
So what is design all about? It is to decrease the amount of vulgarity in the world. It is to make the world a better place to be. But everything is relative. There is a certain amount of latitude between what is good, what is elegant, and what is refined that can take many, many manifestations. It doesn’t have to be one style. We’re not talking about style, we’re talking about quality. Style is tangible, quality is intangible. I am talking about giving to everything that surrounds us a level of quality.<br>
