        <span id="blockquote"><blockquote>
            The “Frankfurt Declaration” as it is referred to within Samsung, is in a way the origin story of their mobile and TV production dominance of today. Samsung are the “biggest electronics company by sales”[FT] on the planet. Their hardware is inside many of the most used devices we all rely on, including other brands such as Apple. Samsung products are everywhere today—most present in our mobile devices. These objects clearly have a huge cultural impact and to know the philosophy that they developed from is some way to start figuring out what these objects are. <sup>1.</sup></blockquote></span>

        <p>Simon Denny’s exhibition opening at Portikus this month revisits a pivotal occasion in the history of the South Korean multinational Samsung. The project is his most recent exploring the broader cultural message implied within the aspirations and legacy associated with a very spectacular but essentially closed, corporate event. It closely follows “Disruptive Berlin”, at Galerie Buchholz which quoted branding, media and rhetoric from a technology conference held in Berlin last year, interrelating aspects of the city’s identity to an emerging part of its economy, namely the local, so-called “start-up” industry. <sup>1.</sup>
