            <div id="answer_one"><p class="answer_one"><span class="M">My</span> background was in arts, I was into makeup effects and that kind of thing like Rick Baker and Stan Winston. Eventually I started making my own movies in high school. That led to me going to film school at USC here in LA. I started to focus more on film making as opposed to makeup effects and this was back in the 90s so there wasn't a lot of digital film, everything was photo-chemical/optical. There wasn't a lot of Visual FX classes either so I ended up focusing on cinematography and graduated with that. I worked in the industry for a bit and fell into editing, then I realized I didn't want to do that. You know you kind of just take the first job that comes along so I ended up as an assistant editor for a couple of years.<br><br>
 
            I went back to school and focused on what I really wanted to do, this was around 2000 when Visual FX was pretty established. I attended the Academy of Arts University in San Francisco where Ronn Brown (a pretty well known visual matte painter) was director of Graduate Studies and taught the first ever Digital Matte Painting class. Caroleen "Jett" Green ("E.T.", "Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom", etc) was a guest lecturer and chose one of my final projects to be featured at a Starbucks around the corner from the Academy of Art (I later worked with Jett at Matte World and at Dreamworks when Ronn asked us to start the Matte Painting Department there in 2005). Ronn brought Craig Barron, the co-founder of Matte World, to the show. Barron saw my work and loved it so he found me and gave me an interview. That's how I got my first job!

            <div id="answer_two"><p class="answer_two"><span class="M">Yeah</span> I kind of feel like it was meant to happen, it wasn't forced it was a natural progression for me. That's how this whole career has been, it didn't come easy I had to work hard and put a lot of effort into it. You just work with a lot of people, they like your work and it snowballs into a career. I guess I'm just glad I ran into Ronn Brown.<br><br>
 
            Matte World was also an invaluable experience where I was mentored by Craig Barron and Chris Evans ("Return of the Jedi", "Willow", etc) for 3 years before moving to LA to start the Matte Painting Department with Jett and Ronn.

            <div id="answer_three"><p class="answer_two"><span class="M">Exactly</span>its a weird dynamic because matte painting is such an interesting craft, it combines so many things. Its not just painting, there's digital painting, photography, CG renders and things like that but you also have to understand camera lenses, lighting, and composition. All of these things combine and then there's the other side of having 3D skills. You have to have an understanding of nature, light and atmosphere. I had an artistic background from when I was a kid and then learning photography and cinematography lead me to the photographic side of it at USC,it all just came together over the years.

            <div id="answer_four"><p class="answer_two"><span class="M">I</span>would say "Avatar". At the time, I didn't know how it would all turn out. I had to go to New Zealand and work on this film everyone had been talking about. I was at Rhythm and Hues at the time and details of the film were top secret but its James Cameron and Weta Digital, how could it not be good? So I decided to go and check it out for 6 months. It was the best experience ever and we hit the ground running. We used VUE, Nuke, and Maya; I had to learn Nuke while I was there but having my background was a great benefit for me. Usually you never know how the movie is going to turn out, but for this movie, once you got there you knew it was going to be a great. The work we had time to do was amazing and the team was good. Cameron was very clear- he was never indecisive, always do what Cameron asks you to do haha. So that was my best experience all around, I still look back and wish I could encapsulate that moment in time.

            <div id="question_five"><p class="question_two">You mentioned Rhythm And Hues. You worked on "Cabin in the Woods" and "Land of the Lost" while there. Those are very different movies from "Avatar", so what were the differences when using VUE? what did you enjoy working on more, animated movies or photo-real?</p></div>

            <div id="answer_five"><p class="answer_two"><span class="M">I</span>like both actually. Since I was trained in it, realism comes more natural for me. Making sure it looks real, I think the difficulty of photo-real is what's taken for granted. Its not as easy as everyone thinks. With photo-real, if it looks painted or manipulated at all its a failure as a matte painting but with animation you get away with a lot more. You can push colors but you have to fit the style of the movie.<br><br>
 
            With photo-real I can hit a target and its not a varying target, its pretty clear: it either looks real or it doesn't. With animation its more subjective like the style "Kung Fu Panda". It is beautiful but you break all the rules of nature because you have green skies and the green skies should influence the the shadows but they don't, the shadows are blue. That's not natural but that's the challenge to make it look right without changing that style. So I like both. Photo-real is more natural to me, I like hitting the target. Creating something that's so believable, people can't even point out what's created, that it all looks like a natural environment. Then there's the animation side where you can push all the colors and accentuate everything in the style that you cant do in photo-real at all.<br><br>
 
            Switching back and forth did take me time to adjust to. You get typecast in this business like with anything. If you're a TV actor its hard to get into feature films and if you're a feature film matte painter its hard to get into animation because they assume you can't do the animated look. There's a weird stigma with both sides and to cross back over is kind of tricky.

            <div id="question_six"><p class="question_two">Anything else you'd like to add? Any advice you'd like to give to anyone willing to enter the Visual FX or Matte Painting industry?</p></div>
            <div id="black_decorative_line_3"></div>
            <div id="orange_twelve"><p id="AAAAAAA">A</p></div>
            <span id="scott_seven"><img src="img/scott_07.jpg" height="209" /></span>
            <div id="answer_six"><p class="answer_two"><span class="M">The</span>most important thing is having a strong foundation artistically and understanding how nature behaves and how lighting in nature works. As a matte painter you're always working on what looks natural - unless its comes to DreamWorks working on films like "Kung Fu Panda", that's an exception. With most movies you're always emulating what natures doing so you have to have a good sense of that.<br><br>
            Train yourself, do some fine arts painting, be out in nature and try to emulate in paint. Its always a good thing to do, I did a lot of that at the academy and I do a lot of that here. We occasionally go out as a group and paint on the weekend.<br><br>
            I think the strongest foundation is having an eye, developing your eye for seeing what nature really does. VUE does a lot of that for you because it has a really good understanding of light and atmosphere in nature which is very important. But you still want an understanding of that without having VUE, using photography for your own reference. You have to really understand what looks right. Some people can art direct you into that but you really have to develop your own sense of what's right and what looks correct. That comes with the experience of looking at and studying nature. Also studying other artists that you are inspired by and understanding why their art is so great. For instance, I alsways go back to the Albert Whitlock, a great matte painter, because his quality of light is very natural, it looks very believable not contrived. It doesn't look like a human hand was involved. That's the biggest thing for me, the quality of light in a matte painting to make it look real and believable.
