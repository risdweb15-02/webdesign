			Split between the old Giardini and the newer Arsenale site at the Venice Biennale, The Encyclopedic Palace is based on the concept of self-taught artist Marino Auriti, who dreamed of devising a museum with the potential to house all of mankind’s greatest achievements in one cohesive space.<br><br>

			The Arsenale exhibit opens with Auriti’s model; the object in which the concept of the whole show is rooted. As a skyscraper compiled of seven tiers it is certainly a modern building,  but it still carries an overall classical feel, with its courtyard entrance and domed turrets at each corner. This amalgamation of old and new is reflected in the works themselves as the pavilion is a collection of modern art all of which was created after the turn of the twentieth century.
