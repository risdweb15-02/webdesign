         <p><span class="name">With the beginning of the War on Terror, the CIA set up a network of secret prisons in Afghanistan and elsewhere around the world</span>. <span class="name">Hundreds of ‘ghost prisoners’ have gone through this system. The black sites have become synonymous with allegations of torture. The locations of the secret prisons have been some of the Bush Administration’s most closely-guarded secrets.</span></p> 

         <p><span class="name">To find the Salt Pit, he used a collection of commercial satellite imagery, a compass, testimonies from former prisoners, and a map drawn by a former prisoner</span>. <span class="name">Although they were blindfolded, hooded, and shacked, prisoners held who spent time at the Salt Pit consistently describe a ten-minute ride from the Kabul International Airport to the prison. he also had a map drawn by a man named Khaled el-Masri of what he believed the interior of the prison looked like</span>. <span class="name">If you draw a circle around the Kabul airport that represents the distance that one might travel in ten minutes, and compare that to el-Masri’s map, the Salt Pit jumps out at you.</span></P>

         <p><span class="name"><a href="../salt-pit/salt-pit.html" target="_blank">The Salt Pit</a></span> is located in <a href="../salt-pit/salt-pit.html" target="_blank"><span class="name">an old brick factory a few miles northeast of Kabul, along an isolated back-road connecting Kabul to Bagram.</span></p>
