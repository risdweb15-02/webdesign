						<p>White Tiger (Kenny)</p>
						<p>Selective Inbreeding, Turpentine Creek Wildlife Refuge and Foundation</p>
						<p>TIn the United States, all living white tigers are the result of selective inbreeding to artificially create the genetic conditions that lead to white fur, ice-blue eyes and a pink nose.  As a result of inbreeding, Kenny is mentally retarded and has significant physical limitations. Due to his deep-set nose, he has difficulty breathing and closing his jaw, his teeth are severely malformed and he limps from abnormal bone structure in his forearms.</P>
