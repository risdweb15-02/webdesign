						<p class="des1">On January 24, 1988, the victim, a young cocktail waitress, was coming home from work when, as she got out of her car, a black man pointed a gun at her face and demanded her money and her purse. She handed them over and her assailant led her from the lighted area in front of her apartment building to a darkened area at the corner of the building. He threatened her with the gun and forced her to remove her hose and underpants and proceeded to rape her. Afterward, the victim suggested they each go their separate ways and the assailant agreed. 
						 </p>
						<p class="des1">At trial, the prosecution presented evidence that the victim had picked out a photograph of Webb at the police station. After declaring that she was ninety-nine percent sure that Webb was her attacker, she picked out another, younger, picture of him. A forensic analyst conducted serology testing on swabs collected from the victim after the attack and found Type A antigens, which were foreign to both Webb and the victim.
