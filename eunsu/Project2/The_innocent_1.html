						<p class="des1">Charles Irvin Fain was convicted and sentenced to death for the murder, rape, and kidnapping of a young girl. The crime occurred in Nampa, Idaho, in 1982. Fain has always maintained his innocence and DNA testing in 2001 revealed the truth of his claim.</p>
						<p class="des1">The victim had been abducted while walking to school. Her body was discovered days later near a river. Police began questioning Fain, who had recently moved into the area. Along with dozens of others, Fain was asked to provide hair samples for comparison to the hairs found on the victim. After performing microscopic hair comparison, the FBI determined that hairs from the crime scene were similar to Fain’s. </p>
						<p class="des1">At trial, the prosecution relied on unvalidated forensic evidence and the testimony of two jailhouse snitches. An FBI hair analyst testified that Fain’s hairs and the hairs from the crime scene were similar and shared an uncommon trait. </p>
