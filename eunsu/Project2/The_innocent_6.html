						<p class="des1">In the early morning hours of March 10, 1985, the victim was approached by a man while walking with one of her friends. The man, known as "Bumpy", grabbed her and asked for change to buy a drink. Later that morning, the police received a call reporting a homicide and found the victim's body. The victim had been stabbed and beaten. Further investigation revealed the presence of semen in her vagina. Jones was convicted by a jury and sentenced to death in a bench hearing.
						 </p>
						<p class="des1">Serological testing was also conducted on swabs from the rape kit. The tests revealed blood group markers consistent with Jones and the victim, and an analyst testified incorrectly that the results excluded a large group as possible perpetrators. In fact, when the evidence being tested is a mixed stain of semen from the perpetrator and vaginal secretions from the victim – and testing does not detect blood group substances or enzymes foreign to the victim – no potential semen donor can be excluded because the victim’s blood group markers could be “masking” the perpetrator’s.
