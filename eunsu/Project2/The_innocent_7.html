						<p class="des1">Both of the victims in the William Gregory case lived in the same apartment complex in Kentucky. Gregory was accused and convicted of rape and burglary of the first victim and of the attempted rape of the second victim. He was sentenced to consecutive sentences of seventy years. The attacks occurred approximately one month apart.

						 </p>
						<p class="des1">At trial, the prosecution presented evidence that Gregory also lived in the apartment complex. Both victims identified him, the second victim through a show-up procedure. Forensic evidence consisted of hairs found in the stocking cap worn and left behind by the assailant. A forensic analyst testified that the hairs were of Negroid origin, they shared “unusual characteristics” with Gregory’s hairs, and were “more than likely” from Gregory. The victim testified that she had not had any African American visitors in her apartment. The analyst’s testimony was invalid because there is not sufficient empirical data on the frequency of various class characteristics in human hair to determine that hairs are “unusual.”
