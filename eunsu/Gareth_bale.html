             <div id="right2"> He is one of the brightest stars in the Real Madrid galaxy, but off the pitch Gareth Bale has his feet firmly on the ground. Now happily settled in Spain, he tells the Telegraph that he has everything he could wish for.</div>

            <div id="right3"> I meet Bale outside downtown Madrid in a sprawling municipal sports centre. As word spreads of the unlikely visitor, gaggles of excited children fresh from PE classes gather. Eventually, we smuggle him into a changing room. </div> 
    
        <div id="question1" class="match">        
                <p><strong>Q > Are you fluent in Spanish yet?</strong></p>
                <p><blockquote>‘In swear words I am,’ he says, grinning. ‘But no, seriously, I’m taking classes every week and I understand so much more now. I certainly understand the team talk. As long as the manager doesn’t speak too quickly.’
                ‘It’s not great. I left school for a reason, and I’ve been dragged back! Not really, of course. Learning a language is something anyone would love to do and I’ve got a great excuse to do it.’</blockquote> </div>

        <div id="question2" class="match">   
                <p><strong>Q > There must be things you miss from home?</strong></p>
                <p><blockquote>‘Some good old British chocolate never goes amiss,’ he says. ‘A bit of Dairy Milk or Galaxy is fantastic. They have Milka here and it’s not the same.’ His eyes light up. ‘Oh, and Nando’s! I do miss a bit of Nando’s. It’s funny; it’s those tiny things you miss. We’ll bring English teabags over with us, and the chocolate. I can’t really move Nando’s over, though, unfortunately.’</blockquote>  </div>

        <div id="question3" class="match">
                <p><strong>Q > And English football? Does the Premier League’s former poster boy miss the cold Tuesday nights away at Stoke? </strong>
                <p><blockquote>‘It’s very interesting watching as an outsider,’ he says. ‘You find you’re more into it when you’re not playing in the league. You’re only concentrating on your team then.’</blockquote> </div>
