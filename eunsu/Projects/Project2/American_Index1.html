						<p>The Waste Encapsulation and Storage Facility, holds a huge amount of radioactive chemicals stored in stainless-steel capsules submerged in cooling pools. The pools look like swimming pools—but they glow an eerie blue from decaying cesium and strontium, chemicals extracted from the site’s main storage tanks because they were causing the waste to get dangerously hot, threatening to damage the tanks. To keep the waste safe, the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) says, the capsules have to be kept under cooled water—but that carries with it a serious risk: If there were a power outage, the water could boil away, and that could cause the 1,936 capsules of radioactive waste to be exposed.</p>
