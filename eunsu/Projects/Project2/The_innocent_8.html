						<p class="des1">On the night of March 1, 1986, the victim, who resided in Waco, Texas, returned home from work. The next morning her body was discovered—she had been beaten, raped, and murdered. It was alleged that Washington, either acting alone or with Joe Sidney Williams, intentionally murdered the victim in the course of committing burglary and sexually assaulting the victim. 

						 </p>
						<p class="des1">SThe state determined the cause of death to be from blunt force injuries and asphyxia by smothering or strangulation. The prosecution also produced evidence that the defendants were in possession of the victim’s car on the morning of March 2, 1986 and had sold items belonging to the victim on the night of the crime. Witnesses testified that Washington had admitted to the burglary and a forensic testified that a bite mark found on the ictim was “consistent” with Washington’s co-defendant. While the analyst excluded Washington as the source of the bite mark, his bite mark testimony about the codefendant (which was given at Washington’s trial) tied Washington to the crime.
