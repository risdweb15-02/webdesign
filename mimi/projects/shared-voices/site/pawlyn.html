                Michael Pawlyn established the architecture firm <a href="http://www.exploration-architecture.com/" target="_blank"> Exploration</a> in 2007 to focus on environmentally sustainable projects that take their inspiration from nature. Since then, he's built a reputation as a thought leader in biomimicry. 
              </p>
              <p>
                He has lectured internationally on biomimicry and innovative approaches to sustainability. In 2007 Michael Pawlyn delivered a talk at Google’s annual ‘Zeitgeist’ conference and, in 2011, became one of only a small handful of architects to have a talk posted on TED.com. In the same year, his book <i>Biomimicry in Architecture</i> was published by the Royal Institute of British Architects.
              </p>
              <p>
                Prior to setting up the company, Pawlyn worked with the firm Grimshaw for ten years and was central to the team that radically re-invented horticultural architecture for the Eden Project. He was responsible for leading the design of the Warm Temperate and Humid Tropics Biomes and the subsequent phases that included proposals for a third Biome for plants from dry tropical regions. In 1999 he was one of five winners in A Car-free London, an ideas competition for strategic solutions to the capital’s future transport needs and new possibilities for urban spaces.
