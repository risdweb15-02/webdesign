        <p id="text">The room feels like an intrusion into the intimate examination of Absence. Still, the two series begin to merge. Both meditate on the discussion that surrounds <a href="exhibition_1.html" style="text-decoration: none" id="hyper_text">disappearance</a>. The lengthy descriptions in Purloined mirror the narratives that appear in Absence. Again, the photographs become the secondary element; the viewer looks toward the descriptions of the stolen works for an indication of what once was. Together, the exhibits attempt an investigation, forcing the viewer to take mere words as inscrutable evidence and wonder if they are enough.</p>
