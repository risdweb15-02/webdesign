        <p id="bibliography">Sophie Calle, Obituary, 2012 from the series: Les Autobiographies Color photograph, aluminum, text, frames 170 x 100 cm + 50 x 50 cm / 67 x 39 1/2 inches + 19 1/2 + 19 1/2 inches </p>

        <p id="text">In Absence, Calle’s current show at Paula Cooper Gallery, her mother’s last word, “souci,” appears frequently, rendered in tall, imposing letters that loom above the other pieces. <br><br> The French word means “worry” and is often uttered within the phrase “Sans souci” or “Don’t worry.” But Calle fails to include the negative “don’t,” turning the show into an exploration on negatives, positives, and neutrals. Like much of Calle’s past work, Absence acts as a mystery novel that tirelessly searches for a <a href="work3.html" style="text-decoration: none" id="hyper_text">missing</a> person. In this case, that person is her mother.
