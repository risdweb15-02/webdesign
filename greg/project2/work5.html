        <p id="bibliography">Sophie Calle, Today my mother died, from the series: Les Autobiographies , 2013, B/W photograph, text, frames, 50,5 x 50,5 cm (text); 76,5 x 50,5 cm (photograph), Number 3 from an edition of 5</p>

        <p id="text">Another wall documents a trip Calle took to Lourdes, a small town in the south of France, while her mother was <a href="exhibition_3.html" style="text-decoration: none" id="hyper_text">dying</a>. Many of the photos capture the mundane—street signs, shuttered shop windows—objects notable to Calle but not the viewer. Long, poetic narratives accompany each photograph. But these dirge-like descriptions overshadow the work they’re meant to enhance. The low-contrast group of images have a prosaic appearance; they’re easy to overlook. In this group, only a few lines of narrative mention Calle’s mother. One section reads, “Was my mother a good mother? I’m already using the past tense.” Despite these reflections on how we grieve for those still living, the Lourdes project lacks the visceral, emotional pull of the rest of the show. </p>
