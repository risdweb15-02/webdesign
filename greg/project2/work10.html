        <p id="text">I was two. It happened on a beach – Deauville, I think. My mother had entrusted me to a group of children. I was the youngest and they had to get rid of me: that was their game. They huddled together, whispering, then burst out laughing and scattered when I tried to come near. And I ran after them, shouting: <a href="work3.html" style="text-decoration: none" id="hyper_text">“Wait for me! Wait for me!”</a> I can still remember.
