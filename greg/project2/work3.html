        <p id="bibliography">Sophie Calle, The Giraffe, from the series: Les Autobiographies, 2012, Color photograph, aluminum, text, frames, 205 x 110 cm + 50 x 50 cm / 6.8 feet x 43 1/4 inches + 20 x 20 inches, Number 3 from an edition of 5</p>

        <p id="text">Using photographs that chronicle Calle’s life during and after her mother’s death, the exhibit explores the liminal space between presence and absence. She creates a world where both qualities can exist at once. <br><br> The center wall displays an array of mixed-media works, ranging from framed paintings that repeat the word “souci,” to enlarged excerpts from her mother’s journal, to a photograph of a taxidermied giraffe named for her mother. Next to the giraffe hangs an inscription reading, “When my mother died I bought a taxidermal giraffe. I named it after my mother and hung it up in my studio. Monique looks down on me with sadness and irony.” Here, Calle blurs the line between mother and giraffe, signifier and signified.
