        <p id="text">In 2005, Sophie Calle’s <a href="work2.html" style="text-decoration: none" id="hyper_text">mother</a> found out she had breast cancer. In 2006, as her mother lay dying, Calle set up a camera at her deathbed and recorded the entire process. “I wanted to be there, to hear the last word,” she told ARTINFO. “I didn’t know if she would have something to tell me at the last minute.”
