        <p id="text">- 40 days ago, the man I love <a href="work5.html" style="text-decoration: none" id="hyper_text">left me</a>.
January 25, 1985, at two in the morning. Room 261, Imperial Hotel, New Delhi. The room is gray, dusty. Only the red telephone stands out. We had been apart for three months and the day before he had confirmed our rendezvous in India. I was happier than I'd ever been before. At last, I was going to see him again. At the airport they handed me a message. He had had an accident and I was to call my father, who is a doctor. All I could think of was that he'd had a crash on the road to the airport. And when I reached him, at home, and he said that he wanted to take me in his arms to explain a few things, I knew at once what that meant: he was dropping me. Only the coward didn't show. He did it over the phone. As for the accident, it was an infected finger.
