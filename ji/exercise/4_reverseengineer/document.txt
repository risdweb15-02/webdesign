The website is mostly containing information about the school. Its main purpose is to give general information about the university, and also, or especially, providing information about the school's academic courses and admission procedures, as they are the two most huge and informative groups. The main targeted audience should be students who are intending to apply for the university (probably high school students' proportion would be the most largest), or people who are seeking for the information about this university, or who are interested in this university.

While nearly all the pages are for providing information to the applying students, the page group "Giving" and "News + Events", "Library" might be for the students in the university. The page "Employment" would be for people who are interested in the university, but they are not applying as a student but as a worker.
