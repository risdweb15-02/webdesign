            <br>
            <p>Immediately received as a manifesto of Postmodernism, Learning from Las Vegas collects presentation materials from the authors' 1968 studio at the Yale School of <a href="file_under_architecture.html">Architecture</a>. Students visited Las Vegas to make an "open-minded and nonjudgmental investigation" of urban sprawl as a new typology, and to study "the symbolism of architectural form." Cooper recalled:</p>
            <p><blockquote>The visual materials were not only graphically rich but as content-laden as the text, so the interdependent rhythms of those relationships were important. I wanted to arrange visual and verbal materials spatially in a nonlinear way to enhance the reader’s comprehension. Creating virtual time and space in two dimensions has always intrigued me.</blockquote></p>
            <p>The authors were less intrigued, and published a redesigned and now-standard paperback edition in 1977 to "de-sex" the original. Their preface pans the first edition's "'interesting' Modern styling," citing "the conflict between our critique of Bauhaus design and the latter-day Bauhaus design of the book." A misguided reference to Cooper's earlier work, the comment also fails to recognize her layout as a subversive departure from, and reworking of, Modernist tenets in its own right.</p>
            <p>Cooper set the book's type on an IBM Selectric Composer typewriter; developed—and frequently broke—a sequential grid system, with one column of text for the first part of the book, two columns for the second, and three for the third; and placed numbers referencing figures over lines of text, channeling the signage of the Vegas strip. She proposed a bubble wrap book jacket with fluorescent dots underneath, "in homage to Las Vegas glitz." Instead, the final, glassine dust jacket superimposed the book's section headings on the cover beneath.</p>
