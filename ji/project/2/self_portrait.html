            <p align="right"><strong>Self-portrait with Polaroid SX-70</strong><br>video imaged and printed at the Visible Language Workshop, MIT, c. 1982</p>
            <p>This composite picture registers at least three different photographic times and as many imaging feedback loops. The finished print was made on the large-format Polaroid printer which appeared in the Workshop around 1982. Workshop coordinator Rob Haimes suggests that it may have been part of the Slow-scan image transmission experiments at the VLW; curved monitor faces and video scan lines confirm this. The stacked pictures are from around 1972, when the Polaroid SX-70 instant camera Cooper holds was released. MacNeil suspects these images were frames captured by a Portapak black-andwhite video camera system, also a brand-new technology in 1972. Around ten years later, frames from the video would have been transmitted as audio tones, displayed on a video monitor, and captured by a large-format Polaroid camera. While all of this imaging proceeded, Cooper is shown taking a picture. What would soon appear on the photograph emerging from her camera remained outside of this imageâ€™s frame.</p>
            <p>From approximately the same period as this portrait, Cooper wrote a bio for herself. Allowed 250 words, she used 65:</p>
            <p><blockquote><a href="main.html">Muriel Cooper</a>/first designer/art director MIT Office of Publications | Fulbright Scholarship, Milan, Italy/ Consulting firm Muriel Cooper Media Design | Media Director <a href="the_mit_press_colophon.html">MIT Press</a>/ currently Director <a href="letterhead.html"><strong>Visible Language Workshop</strong></a> | <a href="course_poster.html">Associate Professor Department of Architecture</a>/ Special Projects Director MIT Press.</p>
            <p>Her concerns have always been with beginnings and process. | More with change and technology and their meanings to human communication than with rigorous graphic design theory and style.</blockquote></p>
