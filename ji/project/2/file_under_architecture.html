            <p align="right"><strong>File Under Architecture</strong><br>HERBERT MUSCHAMP<br>The MIT Press, Cambridge, MA, 1974, English</p>
            <br>
            <p>Cooper acted as both designer and typographer of Muschamp’s book, achieving quicker feedback and greater control while also cutting costs. Setting type on an IBM Composer enabled her to make quick changes, saving the time and expense of sending corrections back to the type house. Switching out the Composer’s various type balls also allowed for this book’s eclectic marginalia.</p>
            <p>The book is printed on brown kraft paper and bound in corrugated cardboard. It was one of <a href="self_portrait.html">Cooper’s personal</a> favorites, and the author saw it as a better argument for the relationship between ephemerality and architecture than he had made in his own writing.</p>
            <p>On the back cover of this (out-of-print) book, Muschamp states: <blockquote>"I am an architect who has neither designed nor built any buildings nor has the inclination to do so. I call myself an architect purely out of the comic conceit which is all that remains of the Western architectural tradition. Buildings have such short lifespans nowadays, and few bother to look at them, anyway. Planning schemes must be revised each year, and still can’t keep up. Last winter’s cosmic-comical conceptual designs are forgotten with the appearance of the new spring line. Books last longer,take up less space, are easier to take care of, make better gifts than do most buildings. In the last analysis, architecture is not a very highly evolved state of mind. This is neither sour-grapes bitterness nor casual frivolity. It is the opening of a passionate, informed, witty, and intensely serious critique of the idea of architecture and an exposure of architectural pretense in all ages, but especially in the modern age—the years following the Industrial Revolution, which have been characterized by visual and ideological chaos and a wholesale dipping into the aesthetic and conceptual capital accumulated by ages past."</blockquote></p>
