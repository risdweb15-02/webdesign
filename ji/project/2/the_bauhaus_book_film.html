            (video based on a video by David Small, based on the original film), c.1970</p>
            <br>
            <p>Soon after completing The Bauhaus, Cooper restaged the book as a film, mounting a 16 mm camera to shoot three frames for every page spread. Later used as a teaching tool, the film demonstrates the logic of page flow, and how much can in fact be “read,” at high speed, of the book’s form and content.</p>
            <p><blockquote><i>All of my books explored implicit <a href="responsive_typography.html">motion</a>. The Bauhaus was designed both statically and filmically with a mental model of slow motion animation of the page elements.</i></blockquote></p>
