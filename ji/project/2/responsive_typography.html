            <p>Cooper described the shifting stakes for design given changes in technology:</p>
            <p><blockquote>You’re not just talking about how the information appears on the screen, you’re talking about how it’s designed into the architecture of the machine, and of the language. You have different capabilities, different constraints and variables than you have in any other medium, and nobody even knows what they are yet.</blockquote></p>
            <p>Consistent digital experiments at the VLW interrogated the screen as typography’s new, native environment. This still output from an animated demonstration imagined typography that <a href="a_primer_of_visual_literacy.html">communicates</a> not only through the static forms of the letters but also through their behavior. Dynamic typography would respond instantly to the changing conditions of its digital context using movement, color, and transparency to inflect meaning.</p>
