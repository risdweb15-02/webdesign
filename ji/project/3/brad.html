                <caption><i>Brad Meltzer: Heroes for My Son</i></caption>
                <br>
                <br>
                <p>Brad Meltzer is the author of the #1 New York Times bestsellers The Inner Circle, The Book of Fate, and seven other bestselling thrillers. His nonfiction books, Heroes for My Son and Heroes for My Daughter, were also New York Times bestsellers. He is the host of the acclaimed History Channel series Brad Meltzer's Decoded and the Eisner Award-winning writer of the comic book series Justice League of America. His newest book is History Decoded: The 10 Greatest Conspiracies of All Time. His new children’s books, including I Am Amelia Earhart and I Am Abraham Lincoln, come out in January 2014. In addition, he is the host of the new series on H2, Brad Meltzer’s Lost History, which presents the stories of various historical artifacts that have gone missing and asks the public to help find them.</p>
                <p>His books have a total of almost six million copies in print, have spent over nine months on bestseller lists, and have been translated into over 25 languages from Hebrew to Bulgarian.</p>
                <p>Meltzer has played himself as an extra in Woody Allen's Celebrity. As a graduate of the University of Michigan and Columbia Law School, he earned credit for writing his first book, which became The Tenth Justice. He's been featured on The Today Show and in major publications including Time, USA Today, Vanity Fair, Entertainment Weekly, and dozens of newspapers across the country.</p>
                <p>His nonfiction books, Heroes for My Son and Heroes for My Daughter, examine global heroes from Gandhi to Rosa Parks to Lucille Ball and the qualities they shared that allowed them to shape the modern world. While cataloging the lives of so many impactful individuals, Meltzer grew to understand three truths to successful leadership: communicate and collaborate with your team; admit and overcome your limitations; and represent your organization, don’t have it represent you. Meltzer expounds on these insights in an article for Spirit Magazine and has shared his philosophies with corporations nationwide.</p>

                <p id="button1"><strong>Brag Like Jefferson: Humility &amp; the Path to Successful Leadership</strong></p>
                <p class="button1">Based on his book, <i>Heroes for My Son</i>, Meltzer shows audiences how successful leaders use humility, collaboration, and an acceptance of their limitations to create meaningful results for their companies or organizations.</p>
                <p class="button1">Using the lives of several prominent leaders and multiple instances of successful CEOs as the backdrop, Meltzer shows that humility is not just an honorable characteristic, but an asset that helps you in the business world. Providing a new way to look at leadership, Meltzer highlights three core rules for success in this keynote speech:</p>
                <ul align="left" class="button1">
                    <li>Communicate and collaborate</li>
                    <li>Admit and overcome limitations</li>
                    <li>Captains are still part of the crew</li>
                    <br>
                </ul>
                <p id="button2"><strong>Who Is Your Hero?</strong></p>
                <p class="button2">On the night Brad Meltzer's first son was born, he began collecting heroes for his boy. And for nearly a decade, Meltzer studied these heroes throughout history. From Thomas Jefferson (who had the humility to never publicly take credit for writing the Declaration of Independence) to the Wright Brothers (who brought extra materials to every test flight, anticipating their own failure) to George Washington to Rosa Parks to Mr. Rogers, Meltzer reminds us that their stories are not about fame – they're about what we are all capable of on our very best days. See why Meltzer's book on heroes – from Jackie Robinson, to Abraham Lincoln, to Eleanor Roosevelt – shot up the inspirational bestseller list. Let Meltzer teach you how to find the real hero in your life. And the power of never letting anyone tell you 'no.'<br><br></p>
                <p id="button3"><strong>What Do You Want in Your Obituary?</strong></p>
                <p class="button3">When <i>The Wall Street Journal</i> told Meltzer that one of his charitable acts would be in his obituary, it sent him on a quest to find out what else might be there. Hear the funny, inspiring, and always entertaining story that led to the creation of Meltzer's book, <i>Heroes For My Son</i>, a book he began writing on the day his son was born eight years ago.<br><br></p>
                <p id="button4"><strong>Don't Let Anyone Tell You 'No'</strong></p>
                <p class="button4">Meltzer's family moved from Brooklyn to Miami with only $1,200 to their name. A decade later, he got 24 rejection letters for his first novel. A year after that, he started his climb to the #1 spot on <i>The New York Times</i> Bestseller List and hosted his own television show. The adventure between is a classic tale with a truly incredible ending.<br><br></p>
