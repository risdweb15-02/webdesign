            <br>
            <p>This series of demos presents “intelligent type” in deep, three-dimensional space. Words advance or recede, and can spin, blur and adapt by changing color or transparency. Formally, the effect might recall film title sequences, but Information Landscapes is an interactive user interface. Here the “viewer” is a “user.” </p>
            <p>Information Landscapes creates a space that allows the user to orient herself within it, seeing where she is going and where she has been. As Cooper said, “Information is of absolutely no use if you can’t find your way through it.” While hyperlinks organize information based on sequencing and branching structures, this environment, Cooper believed, would release one from such constraints.</p>
            <p>The effect of 3D motion would not have been possible without the processing power of the Media Lab’s newly acquired Silicon Graphics Reality Engine, a quarter-million dollar computer:</p>
            <p><blockquote>3D has always interested us, but only recently have we had the power to explore the boundaries between two-dimensional and three-dimensional design information. We are looking for new design principles and we’re not at all sure what they are.</blockquote></p>
            <p>Presented publicly at the 5th TED conference, designers and technologists received Information Landscapes as an epiphany. It is difficult not to consider it Cooper’s culminating work, as she died of a heart attack just a few months later. TED founder Richard Saul Wurman dedicated his book Information Architects (1996) to her, and her “real-time display of heavenly navigation.” Negroponte eulogized Cooper by saying:</p>
            <p><blockquote><a href="main.html">She has broken the flatland of overlapping opaque rectangles with the idea of a galactic universe.</a></blockquote></p>
            <p>Information Landscapes represents both a path not taken in interface design, and one we are only now beginning to travel.</p>
