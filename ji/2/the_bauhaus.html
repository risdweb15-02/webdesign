            <p align="right"><strong>Bauhaus: Weimar, Dessau, Berlin, Chicago</strong><br>HANS WINGLER<br>
            The MIT Press, Cambridge, MA, 1978; originally published 1969, English</p>
            <br>
            <p>The Bauhaus (1969) assembles nearly <a href="posters_to_promote_the_bauhaus.html">200</a> archival documents and 800 illustrations, many never before published. Cooper spent two years on this book alone—an enlarged, revised, and completely redesigned version of an earlier German edition.</p>
            <p>Bauhaus has established itself with designers and architects as a standard work and the most comprehensive collection of documents and pictoral material ever published on this famous school of design. Documents in Bauhaus are taken from a wide array of sources—public manifestos, private letters, internal memoranda, jotted-down conversations, minutes of board and faculty meetigs, sketches and schemata, excerpts from speeches and books, newspaper and magazine articles, Nazi Polemics, official German government documents, court proceedings, budgets, and curricula. The illustrations include architectural plans and realizations, craft and industrial model designs (furniture, ceramics, metalwork, textiles, stained glass, typography, wallpaper), sculpture, paintings, drawings, etchings, woodcuts, posters, programs, advertising brochures, stage settings, and formal portraits of such Bauhaus Masters as Walter Gropius, Lyonel Feininger, Wassily Kandinsky, Paul Klee, Laszlo Moholy-Nagy, Josef Albers, Hebert Bayer, Marcel Breuer, and Ludwig Mies van der Rohe.</p>
