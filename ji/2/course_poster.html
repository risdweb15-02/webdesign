            <p align="right"><strong>Messages and Means course poster</strong><br>MURIEL COOPER, RON MACNEIL<br>designed and printed at the Visible Language Workshop, MIT, c. 1974</p>
            <br>
            <p>Messages and Means was the first class Cooper taught at MIT, begun while she was still at the Press. A friend introduced her to Ron MacNeil, a physicist working for the photographer Minor White. MacNeil had convinced his department to purchase a sheet-fed offset printer and found space to house it in the Department of Architecture. A mutual interest in experimental printing, and the possibility of using this press, inspired Messages and Means, a kind of foundation course in graphic design and handson production for students across MIT.</p>
            <p><blockquote>Messages and Means was design and communication for print that integrated the reproduction tools as part of the thinking process and reduced the gap between process and product.</blockquote></p>
            <p>This poster uses the “rotation” technique central to the course—a design constraint intended to produce quick, collaborative, and often unexpected results. Four students applied press type to acetate, exposing the printing plate directly from the mechanical artwork. A square sheet of paper was then passed at least four times through the press, changing ink color with each run. The product was known as a “one-night print,” initiating students quickly in an otherwise intimidating technology.</p>
            <p><blockquote>They used the offset printing press as an artist’s tool: they collaborated on platemaking and they altered the application of inks -- they rotated the paper to make printing an interactive medium.</blockquote></p>
            <p>Cooper’s interests in making and modifying tools, rapid feedback, interactivity, and responsive means of production are met in these prints by her formal interests in transparency and the layering of <a href="information_landscapes.html">information</a>, which became even more pronounced in her later work.</p>
