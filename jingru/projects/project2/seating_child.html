						<strong>1945</strong></br></br>
						Evans Molded Plywood</br></br>
						Made of two pieces of molded plywood, attached to one another by three small rivets in the seat.</br></br>

						Manufactured by the Molded Plywood Division of Evans Products in 1945.</br></br>

						From Pat Kirkham's CHARLES AND RAY EAMES: DESIGNERS OF THE TWENTIETH CENTURY, page 216: "The Eames stackable plywood chairs, tables, desks and stools for children, produced and distributed by the Evans Product Company beginning in the middle of 1945, were the first such pieces designed by them to be mass produced; the first and only production run was 5000. Brightly stained in red, yellow, blue and magenta, this furniture was promoted as easily cleaned, able to withstand the rigors of classroom use, and suitable for outdoor as well as indoor use. The chairs, developed from earlier experimental ones, were formed out of two pieces of plywood, one serving as the legs and seat and the other as the back. An interesting feature was the cut-out heart motif. . . .The cut-out heart shape was a well known folk motif that linked the chairs to the past; it was also a tried and tested handhole for lifting."</br></br>
