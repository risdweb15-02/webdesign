	I chose three of my favorite artists from different realms in art: Ito Toyo in architecture, Hayao Miyazaki in film, and Yayoi Kusama in fine art. After choosing the three speakers I noticed that all of them happened to be artists from Japan. I wanted to make this point the "glue" between the three speakers, and considered what may be the particular element in the three artists' work that may reflect the Japanese heritage. Thus I decided upon the keywords "subtle" and "sensitivity," and designed the theme of the shared voices event and the website accordingly.
