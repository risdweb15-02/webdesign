      Jacob, can you please talk about the role that architecture played in each interpretation of Gas Giant and how it has tested &#34;the limits of language, to reinterpret the space of the piece&#34; especially in the case of the third and final presentation at MOCA Pacific Design Center?</p>

      <strong><p>JACOB HASHIMOTO</strong>
      The MOCA Pacific Design Center is a very peculiar building. It changes the language of the piece again. In some ways the MOCA Pacific Design Center is really the ideal building for the piece because it is a cube, and the whole artwork is based on cubes, so logically it&#39;s a lot easier to think about. Now, the question is that because of the clean formal minimalist grid-based nature of the building, relative to the grid-based nature of the artwork, coming into the space it&#39;s been almost &#34;too much&#34; in harmony with the nature of the artwork; it is a grid inside a grid. On the first floor, a big part of the struggle was to subvert that grid, to destroy it, tangle it up, and mess with it in ways that made Gas Giant more in conflict with the architecture to create a more interesting context for the work when the work isn&#39;t perfectly in line with the sensibility of the architecture. That is why we see this kind of violence on the ground floor. Because the space is so vertical on the second floor, it lends itself to being hugely atmospheric. There is this very open, clean poetics, this big space that you want to feel big, because you can actually put artwork in all the different nooks and crannies of the space. We can draw the viewer&#39;s attention to the size and emphasize the verticality of the space, which a lot of pieces that have worked [previously] in the space have played with, but I think the way that this piece functions will frame it in a way that we have not seen before.</p>

      <strong><p>SP</strong> Can you please tell us how your work is conceptually related to sacred architecture&#45;a subject you have mentioned as being of interest? Is part of your intention to create an organic viewing experience similar to a ritualistic encounter with architecture and space?</p>

      <strong><p>JH</strong> When I was drawn to the idea of sacred architecture and church&#45;like spaces, my interest in large part was this sense of awe that you get when you walk into a cathedral or a building: the sense of the architecture lifting you up into spaces that you didn&#39;t know were possible. On one hand, pieces like Gas Giant really try to capture the sense of awe that we get when we walk into these kinds of large, sacred spaces, but also the way that you move through those spaces when they create narratives and their sense of purpose is built into the architecture. When we&#39;re dealing with contemporary art spaces, we have a much less specific mission in terms of what those spaces can do for the viewer, so we can create more complicated or more poetic narratives that people can read as they travel through the space. I am interested in how the spaces were built in order to shape the types of visual and sculptural narratives that would draw viewers through the space with a sense of expectation. How do you create expectation in a space? How do you create the illusion of purpose? How do you build those kinds of spaces that hint at a greater purpose in themselves? Those are the kinds of things that a lot of these sacred spaces do, and it has to do with religious and spiritual baggage that you bring along with you. As an artist you know that you cannot master that kind of complexity of nature, but can you understand it in a way that communicates a sensibility to your viewer, and maybe you can distill some sensibility about that that maybe they don&#39;t get in their everyday life. That is the way that I&#39;ve always seen those kinds of structures so it&#39;s natural that I work within a naturalistic language.</p>

      <strong><p>SP</strong> Continuing with the idea of architecture and landscape in your work, you have mentioned that your work is in part influenced by post&#45;war American abstract painting and landscape compositions, as well as the Light and Space movement from the 1960s in Southern California. Can you please talk about the characteristics of post&#45;war abstraction and Light and Space that inform your work?</p>

      <strong><p>JH</strong> My early experiences with James Turrell were the kind of awe that he could capture in a simple gesture, so this is the meeting of minimalism and poetics. Michael Asher did similar pieces like the lifting of the air jet piece when he was shooting a single beat of air out into the space. John McLaughlin was using the same sort of vocabulary with scale. The work was also minimal in such a simple idea, but all these artists out here in the West were capturing something greater than that. I don&#39;t think that artists of my generation can necessarily get away with that. Maybe they can, but it seems harder and harder to get away with that, and maybe it&#39;s because of the art fairs, the internet, or maybe the speed at which life moves now, and the culture of the art star, but my sense is that in those kind of vocabularies, simplicity and elegance aren&#39;t really available as much to me as maybe they were to that generation of artists.</p>

      <p>When you go to any of my shows, I think you understand the mechanics of how everything works. A lot of people don&#39;t understand that the pieces are all cut paper, that they are collaged, and that the process is actually a repetition of gluing stuff on top of stuff creating layers and levels of complexity. People think that this process is more complicated than it is, but the heart of the pieces is very open; you look and you see the exposed knots, and you know exactly how this piece is put together. I think that kind of simplicity comes out of my interest in people like Agnes Martin and Larry Poons, who were doing single&#45;mark repetition in the 1960s and 1970s, and Robert Ryman who is still making white paintings over and over with that kind of limited vocabulary. All these artists were working with a really minimal vocabulary and talking about really complicated things.</p>

      <strong><p>SP</strong> In connection with the art movements of Southern California since the 1960s, please tell us about the influence of the 1990s generation of California artists exploring landscape painting and of your experience living in Los Angeles in the late 1990s. You have mentioned in the past that you &#34;moved away from painting and printmaking&#34; to work on three&#45;dimensional objects, but it seems to me that you never abandoned painting and instead have expanded its strategies to continue to explore abstraction and also to talk about how painting can also be studied through other mediums. Is your current approach a suitable vehicle to do so?</p>


      <strong><p>JH</strong> All my friends still say that I&#39;m a painter. In terms of the 1990s generation of California artists, it really goes back earlier than that, when we talk about people like Craig Kauffman, Turrell, Robert Irwin, McCracken… the plasticky modes of artificial nature that were going on with those artists was always interesting. My great attraction with people like Jason Meadows, Laura Owens, Monique Prieto, and Jason Rhoades is that these artists are all standing on the shoulders of that generation. When I was coming out of school in the mid&#45;1990s, L.A. was the most exciting place to think about coming to be an artist. Here you had these people with very unique voices when nobody was looking at Los Angeles, and nobody expected it, and the art schools were good but nobody was thinking about them that much. I could not understand why young artists were going to New York, because I just didn&#39;t think there was anything interesting going on there. In Los Angeles you had this group of artists that came just before [me]&#45;they must have been five or six years older than me and they were led by a group of women painters, Laura Owens especially. Her early paintings were huge landscapes, with the sliding grids that kind of disappeared, and those paintings were so fresh&#45;feeling. They gave me the sense that I could work in landscape in a way that nobody had done before, and that there was possibility. I think it was people like Laura Owens combined with people like Jessica Stockholder that allowed me to hobble together the kind of vocabulary that is evidenced in the show. Another artist is Jason Rhoades, and all of his treatment of spaces, which he owes to Jessica Stockholder, but also this sense of freedom and possibility in his work. This kind of &#34;much-ness&#34; involved in his sensibility was infectious when you saw the kind of power that you could squeeze out of that. Monique Prieto, Owens, Ingrid Calame, and Kevin Appel were people that I was really looking at when I came here; they were doing stuff with architecture, landscape, and abstraction that nobody else was really doing. I think that I am a painter. When I say &#34;I moved away from painting and printmaking&#34; it was because in order to make it as a painter when you&#39;re 24 years old, you want to be more proactive and louder, more aggressive about the kinds of things that you&#39;re making, so that you can differentiate yourself from the crowd, which is a huge part of your job when you&#39;re a young artist. From a strategic standpoint I think it made sense at the time to not really focus on making traditional paintings, but the aesthetic of what I do is painting&#45;based. It does everything that a painting does expanded into physical space.</p>

      <strong><p>SP</strong> Your work, through the knowledge of your Japanese&#45;American background, has also been connected directly to Japanese traditions of landscape and kite&#45;making, while it seems to me the connection goes beyond Asian cultural traditions and is more related to the specific use of the material. Invariably, one can never escape his or her own context and subjectivity, but can you please talk about your use of paper, collage, modularity, flatness, pattern, and repetition present in your work, and how all these aspects are important strategies to your studio practice?</p>

      <strong><p>JH</strong> The kite thing is interesting because I started making kites in school to fly in the park, but I wasn&#39;t making Japanese kites, I was making European kites, like Ben Franklin sort of diamond&#45;shaped kites with tails on them. As I taught myself more and more, I started using Japanese&#45;type patterns, but also Thai and Chinese patterns, but most of those patterns actually entered the work because I was looking for different forms. From a formal standpoint I was looking for different shapes, how they were built, how they were tensioned, what their inherent characteristics were, and I wanted flat kites because they were more useful to me from a structural standpoint, in terms of how I was assembling things at the time. Then it came down to how you could connect these pieces together based on those traditional forms. Ultimately I ended up using a lot of Chinese kites because they are mostly wood, which allow you to pull and stretch and mount. They can also handle a lot more paper and layers of process without getting destroyed or too warped. These days most of the kites that I&#39;m using are Chinese from a company in Weifang, which is the world center of traditional kite making.</p>

      <p>There are a lot of layers of process in what I do that consist of me figuring out how much I actually need to be involved with generating images and creating patterns, how much freedom I will give to my assistants, how much of the fabrication will be farmed out to companies that we have very little control over, and distilling and figuring out what the most important aspects of the process are. That&#39;s really changed the way I work in ways that I am not sure that I&#39;m totally comfortable with, but I think that if you want to work at this scale and you want to make more than one piece in your life, you have to work with offsite fabricators and assistants, and this is kind of the nature of the process that I’ve created. [In regards to] material, a lot of what&#39;s happened with the paper is that people have made assumptions on how Japanese or Asian the work is, but if you&#39;re trying to find a paper to do what we need those papers to do, in terms of transparency and &#34;collageability,&#34; and the way they behave, you almost always have to use Asian paper just by virtue of the nature of how they&#39;re made.</p>

      <p>They&#39;re long fiber papers and they&#39;re handmade so they don&#39;t have grain direction. People have really looked into that as content. Yes, it&#39;s content, but there is a structural reason that people never talk about. We can&#39;t really do what we do with any other material. I&#39;ve looked, I&#39;m still looking for other sorts of possibilities, but it&#39;s just hard to find paper that can do that.</p>

      <strong><p>SP</strong> Lastly, you have expressed that your use of kite&#45;like elements is in part due to your interest in nostalgia, possibility, and optimism. Can you please describe how Gas Giant functions in these terms?</p>

      <strong><p>JH</strong> The nice thing about the kites is that for a while I was very curious as to why they are so appealing to people. I think that in this day and age we don&#39;t see that many handmade objects, so people are really attracted to this sense of hand and the sense of traditional crafts that are disappearing. In cultures that have lost more of those kinds of traditions, the sense of attachment to this work is greater. And to a culture like ours, when we see really high&#45;quality handmade objects, it becomes nostalgic, it&#39;s like &#34;oh I remember when I could get one of these at the corner store, for like 10 cents or whatever.&#34; It&#39;s also about childhood and in some ways it&#39;s about loss. When I talk about possibility it is also through that sense of loss and optimism, and because I think that the artworks, while they are very beautiful, they are also a little bit melancholic, and they are not all about joy and happiness.</p>
      <p>There&#39;s a lot of toil that goes into making this, and it&#39;s not really evidenced in the work as content, but any thinking person that walks into this space and considers the number of knots, and the amount of folding and the amount of human time that has taken to put this thing together that is temporary, that is going to be destroyed, [makes it sad]. The greater the beauty the more sad it is. There&#39;s a tremendous amount of potentiality when you arrive and you&#39;re building it, and you&#39;re optimistic, but it&#39;s all couched in this idea of being temporary, just in the simple fact that this beautiful thing is not going to be here forever, that you have to go see it if you want to experience it.</p>
