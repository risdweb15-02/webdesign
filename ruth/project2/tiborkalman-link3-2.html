		"In the piece called 'What if...? the celebrities were <a href="tiborkalman-link3-3.html">chosen</a> because they would be recognized by their <a href="tiborkalman-link3">faces</a> only - <a href="tiborkalman-link3.html">globally</a>. The idea was that if you could separate the person from their <a href="tiborkalman-link3.html">race</a> you could then figure out how you <a href="tiborkalman-link2-2.html">feel</a> about the race <a href="tiborkalman-link1-2.html">versus</a> the person. So when you look at the black Queen, you think 'does she dance better? Is Buckingham Palace <a href="tiborkalman-link1-2.html">playing</a> cool Caribbean <a href="tiborkalman-link1.html">music</a> at receptions?' And as you explore these questions you become conscious of your own racism."
