			Tibor Kalman is universally acclaimed as one of the greatest and most gifted graphic designers in the history of mankind. A true creative genius and a passionate rebel, his highly celebrated work for the Talking Heads, Restaurant Florent, Interview, and Colors left behind an immense influence on art, literature, society, culture and morality.

		<p id="text-paragraph">
			In 1979 he established a startup design firm, with the help of Carol Bokuniewicz and Liz Trovato, two of the former designers from <a href="http://www.barnesandnoble.com/help/cds2.asp?PID=8184" target="_blank">B&N</a>. It was named <a href="http://www.mandco.com/corporate/our-history/our-history/our-history.html">M&Co</a>. after Kalman’s wife and the firm’s co-creator, Maira. Their early client base consisted of banks and department stores.
		</p>
		<p id="text-paragraph">
			The reputation of M&Co. as a groundbreaking innovator in the design world - with a fantastic body of work that wonderfully blends humor, wit and social satire – built steadily, thanks to their unique style cleverly shifting between deadpan and expressive.
