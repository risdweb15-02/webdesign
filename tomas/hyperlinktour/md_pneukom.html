      <h2>Neukom Vivarium</h2>
      <p>Fern will be sure to die at the end of a couple years, if you prevent it from putting forth leaves ; the most efficient method of ensuring this is to beat the branches with a stick while they are in bud ; for then the juices that drop from it will kill the roots. It is said, too, that fern will not spring up again if it is pulled up by the roots about the turn of the summer solstice, or if the stalks are cut with the edge of a reed, or if it is turned up with a plough-share with a reed placed upon it. In the same way, too, we are told that reeds may be effectually ploughed up, if care is taken to place a stalk of fern upon the share. Democritus has described a method of rooting up a forest, by first macerating the flower of the lupine for one day in the juice of hemlock, and then watering the roots of the trees with it.</p>

      <p>During the last decade of his life Henri Matisse deployed two simple materials—white paper and gouache—to create works of wide-ranging color and complexity. An unorthodox implement, a pair of scissors, was the tool Matisse used to transform paint and paper into a world of plants, animals, figures, and shapes.</p>
