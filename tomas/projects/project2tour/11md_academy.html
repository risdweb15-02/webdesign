      <h2>The Academy of Things</h2>
      <p>Dion, the artist of international renown, carried out his first project in the City Dresden, of the region Germany, by invitation of the Art Academy. He excelled in his organizations of the collections of the Dresden Art Academy. Innumerable are the works accomplished in drawings and prints via videos, photographic essays, sculpture, installations and  dioramas to singular expeditions. Dion travelled the world, and gave order with museums and  collections of the greatest caliber, using his artistic excellence to challenge the claim their authorities made to sole sovereignty ; and when they tried to claim oath he denied them the interpretation of knowledge.</p>

      <h3>Selecting</h3>
      <p>In Dresden too, Dion trawled the depots of the illustrious collections, questioning the caretakers known to live there and doing better than they traditionally applied in their practices, shewing great worth to the arts. The objects from all around the world which they collect and display, were transformed. There were debates about the historical context of collections, for Dion in singular foresight rearranged their holdings in his complex operations. The Academy’s own exhibition space, the Octagon – was transformed into an Academy of Things, and this was a remarkable and new invention to the city that has driven the directions of its arts there since.

      <h3>Questioning</h3>
      <p>The artistic experiments at the Octagon, HfBK Dresden, and the two satellits, the Green Vault and the Albertinum, were designed to test precepts and inventions for handling exhibits. The owners thereof asked "How  can we make the histories of things visible? What is the status of damaged or ruined objects? How might these things conceivably be ordered in new ways? What role does the material culture of past centuries play in present‐day teaching?"</p>
