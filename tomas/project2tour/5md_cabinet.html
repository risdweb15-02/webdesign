      <h2>Cabinet of Curiosities</h2>
      <p>In consideration of the forms in which man seeks to understand the world, various forms have been proposed to concieve of this understanding ; of these collection is by far the best, for it offers glimpses to the world far apart and joins together elements which would never chance to fall next to eachother. We are given deeper insights to the laws of nature which deem that something may exist, and by examining the similarities between these things we may understand further how they exist as well.  As declaimed by Plato the truth of things cannot be found in the things themselves ; so by collection instead we may look at the distances between things and through that understand precisely their natures.</p>

      <h3>A question of old on the nature of invention</h3>
      <p>It is a great and ancient question: do we invent that which is found, or do we find that which we suppose we invent?</p>

      <p>Of curiosity much and more is written, but the greatest have always a proclivity towards it ; for it tells us of the enigmas which lay beyond the veil of day-to-day life, and encourages a firmer and fuller ciew of. Curiosity brought together says almost as much of those who have organized their mysteries as their posessions.</p>
