      <p>It is to note that the invention of certain objects allows for the discovery of others, and introducing these objects into environments harsh and unforgiving can still offer new revelations on them; the catcher's net, the metal detector, the rope trap are these tools. A team of well-trained men under competent direction and commanding a pack of mules can venture forth through spaces picked clean, known to hold only stretches of emptiness ; and using such tools as mentioned may renew their sights of nature to include a host of previously unseen nuances. We are indebted to the historian and artist Dion in the revival of these practices, and found of his equipment from the explorations in the final era of the Millenium.</p>

      <p><span class="quote">&#8220;The way knowledge has evolved is very much segmented and fragmented into societies of experts, so itâ€™s incredibly difficult for an engineer to speak to a physicist, to speak to a chef to speak to an artist. At one time those things were very close together, so there is a kind of nostalgia in me for that moment when these fields of expertise were not so exclusive; there was a more general search for knowledge that could be shared across disciplinary borders.&#8221;</span></p>
