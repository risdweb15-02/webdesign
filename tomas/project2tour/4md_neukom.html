      <h2>Neukom Vivarium</h2>
      <p>To cultivate the systems of nature, a fallen log of western hemlock, which holds an antipathic essence to its cousin the weed, may be removed to a well-prepared setting. On this log which some may call dead, and which the simple-minded will call abandoned by nature, will be singularly favored her succors as a forest of mosses and small plants again is reborn from its matter. Therefore it is extremely difficult to cultivate plants in lands which have not known the death of plants before, such as deserts or certain barren areas unfavored by the growth of things.</p>

      <h3>On the special preparations necessary for increased renewal of dead matter</h3>
      <p>It is written that the essences of airs vary from climate to climate ;  and so to remove a plant from its natural climate is akin to the drowning of it, unless special accomodations are made to preserve these airs.  A tight house with colored glasses, with hues matching the immediate plants of the forest site from which the log came,  must be built at approximately one-and-a-third length of the log. Soils should be removed as well together with the log. In regards to this artifice: it is known some persons are for drinking ice, and thus is the curse of the mountain steep turned into an appetizing stimulus for the palate !  Cold is carefully treasured up for the summer heats, and man's invention is racked how best to keep snow freezing in months that are not its own. Some again there are who first boil the water, and then bring it to the temperature of winter&mdash;indeed, there is nothing that pleases man in the fashion in which Nature originally made it.</p>

      <h3>On ferns and other pestilences</h3>
      <p>Fern will be sure to die at the end of a couple years, if you prevent it from putting forth leaves ; the most efficient method of ensuring this is to beat the branches with a stick while they are in bud ; for then the juices that drop from it will kill the roots. It is said, too, that fern will not spring up again if it is pulled up by the roots about the turn of the summer solstice, or if the stalks are cut with the edge of a reed, or if it is turned up with a plough-share with a reed placed upon it. In the same way, too, we are told that reeds may be effectually ploughed up, if care is taken to place a stalk of fern upon the share. All manner of similar growths and insects will spawn in this new habitat, of which it must be taken care to distinguish those species that will offer something productive to the growth of the plant and those that will imping it.</p>
