      <h2>Tate Thames Dig</h2>
      <p>The river Thames takes its rise in Gloucestershire, by some writers called Avon; The site at which it rises from the ground is called the Thames Head, however authors have disputed its source to be the Trewsbury mead, still others make claim for Seven Springs; of these declarations the third is false, for from Seven Springs rises the river Churn which runs sibling to Thames and falls itself into it, at a short distance of 20 miles, by which it is carried into the English Channel. This is the waterway which runs through the heart of London, and from which we may say both commerce and life are fed.  In it the artefacts of several millenia have accumulated, the fruits and faults of antiquity, and even still the antiquities of antiquity !</p>

      <h3></h3>
      <p>In efforts organized by the Museum Tate, citizens combed river mud and beach to procure artefacts buried therein. These efforts and discoveries were carried out during the last year of the millenium; first on the foreshore of what is now Tate Britain and of the new Tate Modern at Bankside, and then on the lawns at Millbank.  The end product was an imposing showcase with glass-fronted cupboards and drawers, filled with artefacts, inside the Millbank Tate.</p>
