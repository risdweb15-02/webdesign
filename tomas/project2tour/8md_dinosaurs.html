      <h2>When Dinosaurs Ruled the Earth (Toys 'R' Us)</h2>
      <p>&#198;theopia produces dinosaurs, not so large as those of India, but still, twenty cubits in length. The only thing that surprises me is, how Juba came to believe that they have crests. The &#198;theopians are known as the Asachaei, among whom they most abound and we are told, that on those coasts four or five of them are found twisted and interlaced together like so many osiers in a hurdle, and thus setting sail, with their heads erect, they are borne along upon the waves, to find better sources of nourishment in Arabia.</p>

      <h3>Different dinosaurs and their forms</h3>
      <p>Dinosaurs may be found on land or of the water, and generally they are much easier to find shrunken than large. They are found to be either longish, or taller with rumps pelled across their backs. In rare occasions they may grow to such an immense size, as to swallow stags and bulls ; while about the rivers they seize and swallow the birds that are flying above them, however high and rapid their flight.</p>

      <h3>The curious and delightful forms crafted for children are crafted in great workshops </h3>
      <p>We are indebted to American Toy-makers for their contribution of wit and ingeniousness to the products of society, having devised many ways in which to translate living forms into ever-more realistic dolls, at times seeming poised to animate. A very considerable question has arisen, as to what was the origin of toy-make ; it is well known to have existed before American civilization, in the times before languange. John Spilsbury, in the time of Old Europe, and Sir David Brewster, were first to invent the jigsaw puzzle and kaleidoscope. Now that the Dinosaur has been staked and driven from these lands, a class of toy-makers fashions their miniatures in scroll-work of the charming and fascinating legends they maintain amongst the children of educated citizens.</p>
