                We met in Tokyo where both of us were spending our formative years working in different design studios. Miki was working amongst others at the studio of Nobuo Nakagaki, a representative of the post-war generation of designers who established a new design ethic in Japan influenced by European Modernism. Tilmann was working at Bluemark (now Atsuki Kikuchi Ltd.) under <a href="http://exhibit.atsukikikuchi.com/" target="_blank">Atsuki Kikuchi</a>, one of the younger art directors who has gained more and more attention in recent years. We were a couple at that time and found out that we speak a common language in terms of design. So it felt natural to set up the studio together.

                “Concept based but playful in execution. Clear in terms of visual language but always with room for interpretation. We always try to infuse a poetic or narrative layer into our visuals, and usually some form of humor.”

                We love the process of researching and getting deep into the subject matter of a project. a new born brand is much like that pot whale in the hitchhiker’s guide to the galaxy that accidentally materializes in space. It has a fully developed brain but doesn’t have any words yet for the phenomena around it. So it starts making up words for things that are deemed important. That’s kind of how it feels to form a language and through that a character for a brand from scratch. You just start with all possibilities and narrow them down bit by bit. Sadly the pot whale had a very short life, which is of course the exact opposite of what we would like to achieve for a brand. Goodbye pot whale and thanks for the metaphor.

                The ideal is to work with someone who shares the same sense of humor as ourselves. If we can laugh together with a client in the first meeting we know the project is going to go well. It’s also great to work with people who can look at something they have never seen before and perceive in a pure and neutral way without preconceptions.
