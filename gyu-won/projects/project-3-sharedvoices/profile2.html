            The RISD Presidential Speaker Series offers a forum for welcoming some of the most expansive thinkers of our times to campus. Each speaker is a master of his or her domain but is also ready to transcend it, sharing the RISD community’s own belief in the fruitful exchange of ideas that happens when artists, designers, activists, scientists and other scholars really talk and listen to each other.

                <h4>Author</h4><br>
                <p>Mac Barnett is the author of fifteen books for children. He was the executive director of 826LA, a nonprofit writing center, and founded the Echo Park Time Travel Mart, a convenience store for time travelers. In this talk about creativity and wonder, he explains why kids are the ideal readers of literary fiction – and what adults can learn from them about imagination and the willing suspension of disbelief.

            <blockquote><em>Childhood is surreal. Why shouldn’t children’s books be? In this whimsical talk, award-winning author Mac Barnett speaks about writing that escapes the page, art as a doorway to wonder — and what real kids say to a fictional whale.</em></blockquote>
