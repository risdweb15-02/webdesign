                    Co-organized by Andrew Blauvelt of the Walker Art Center and Ellen Lupton of the Cooper-Hewitt National Design Museum, Graphic Design—Now in Production is the single largest exhibition of contemporary graphic design to take place in the United States in over 15 years. The show surveys critical highlights from the past decade to signify the expanding role of graphic designers: as editors, authors, curators, publishers, and shapers of content, whose works often frame the process and discipline itself as a tool for production, reflexivity, and praxis.<br><br>

                    Project Projects was commissioned by the Walker to develop the show’s graphic identity, and together with Leong Leong Architects, designed the New York installation presented by the Cooper-Hewitt. The studio also had work featured in the show, and contributed an essay to the accompanying catalogue.<br><br>

                    Located on Governors Island in a former Army warehouse far from the Cooper-Hewitt's primary Manhattan location, the 8,000-square foot exhibition space required an intensive remediation process to accommodate the installation. The resulting exhibition makes creative use of site-specific constraints, engaging audiences in inventive ways, and aligning graphic design as a medium for public consumption. In an adjacent hallway, an overview of the exhibition samples works from each of its thematic sections. The exhibition space itself is organized as a set of thematic corridors as well, partitioned by black geometric voids that anchor exhibition furniture originally designed and fabricated for the Walker installation. The resulting installation combines new and old, clean and rough, into a dense exhibition experience spanning the gamut of contemporary graphic design production.
