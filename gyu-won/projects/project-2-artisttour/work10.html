                    An exhibition designed and co-organized by Project Projects in April 2010, Fast Trash examined how waste moves through the City and considered the pneumatic tube––<br>a novel trash circulation system that has served Roosevelt Island since 1975. Launched in 2011, its companion website fasttrash.org includes all the original exhibition materials, along with extended documentation, news, and updates about the project.<br> A whooshing red blur, evocative of the pneumatic tube installed at the exhibition site, signals the transition between sections and exhibition photos.
