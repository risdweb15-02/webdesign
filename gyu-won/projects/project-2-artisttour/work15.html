                    Organized by Creative Time, “The Plain of Heaven” was a group exhibition in a vacant meatpacking warehouse at the southern terminus of the High Line in Manhattan. Project Projects designed the show’s exhibition graphics, catalog, website, and collateral materials. Anticipating the building’s demolition following the show’s conclusion, the exhibition graphics were spray-painted directly onto its exterior and interior surfaces in a <a href="work04.html"><mark>custom-designed stencil typeface</mark></a>. The show’s catalog features the artists’ work and curator’s texts, and includes a hidden photographic narrative by Project Projects on the inside of its french-folded pages.
