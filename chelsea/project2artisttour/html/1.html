            We chose graphic design not just for the sake of being graphic designers. It was some kind of social commitment, a way to earn a living and also to disseminate our ideas. The activities related to graphic design are very suitable for us. We enjoy the thinking process, but we prefer that it be related to form and that ideas have tangible <a href="2.html">results</a>. Also, we don’t create things out of the blue, we want to form a <a href="3.html">relationship</a> with someone. But, as such, graphic design doesn’t excite us more than any other media, than <a href="4.html">film</a> or books for example.
