            Based in France, we were able to completely <a href="14.html">redefine</a> the way we see graphic design. There are so few French designers that the field is not precisely defined in the way it is in say Germany, the UK or the US. There, you settle down to do corporate design, or record sleeve design, whereas in France there is still a great deal of room for experiment and <a href="15.html">crossover</a>.
