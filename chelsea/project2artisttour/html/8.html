             We see our work as more than providing a service. We are using our place as graphic designers strategically, in order to diffuse ideas. We are not against fine art, but we believe in some kind of <a href="1.html">relationship</a> between the work and the people who commission the work. Very often in the art world relationships between the artist, the gallery and the collector are sterile, not productive or inspirational. In both fields we are dealing with ideas and often we find similar obsessions, that we are tracking the same line of thought. When we <a href="9.html">collaborate</a> with artists, it is because the artists have asked us for our expertise. Whether what we produce is art or not, I donâ€™t know. That is up to history to decide.
