    A forensic artist is asked to make a 3D facial reconstruction of a subject in ecstasy. She is provided with the standard elements of her trade: a skull, hair sample, and a forensic report. 

The skull was produced from cat scans taken at the Utrecht Hospital in the Netherlands. Jill Magid filled out a standard forensic report, <a href="composite.html" class="textlinkhead">describing herself</a> as missing, in a state of ecstasy. The head is realized from this material alone, without the forensic artist ever having met her missing subject.
