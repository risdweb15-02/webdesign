 This section includes Jill Magid's experiments with mirrors in which she incorporated mirrors on the interior of clothing and shoes (Mirrored Trench Coat; Mirrored Skirt, Mirror Shoe) and perform their use in the public realm. Videos from this period employ denist mirrors (Stolen, 2000) and cut mirrors (Suburbia, 2001; Traincatcher, 2001) in order so that she can capture and hold things —such as skycrapers, trains, and details of paintings—that would otherwise remain out of my physical reach.
