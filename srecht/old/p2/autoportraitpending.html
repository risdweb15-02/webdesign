        In 2005, Jill Magid signed a contract with a company to become a diamond when she dies. The contract specifies the agreement for her <a href="head.html">transformation</a> and the details of her eventual diamond. Upon her <a href="onkilling.html">death</a>, the diamond will be created from the carbon of her <a href="salemdiamonds.html">cremated remains.</a> It will have a round cut, weigh one carat, and be set in a gold ring. Until the diamond′s creation, the empty ring setting, the corporate contract, the artist’s preamble, and the Beneficiary Contract constitute the artwork.
