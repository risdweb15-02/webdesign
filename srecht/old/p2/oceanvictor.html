        <div id="oceantextmain"> In 2007 Jill Magid came back to New York City after living five years abroad. She rented an apartment in Brooklyn and took the subway often. Everyone was in transit, except the officers. She approached one and asked him to search her. She began to accompany this officer on many of his nighttime posts. He was not sure if he could trust her, and she was not sure if she should trust him. They continued to <a href="kissmask.html">meet</a> despite this.
