        ON KILLING 
            <br></br> 
        <br></br> 
    This series of neon works is inspired by Lt. Col. Dave Grossman’s influential 2009 book On Killing: The Psychological Cost of Learning to Kill in War and Society. Online controversies surrounding law enforcement protocol, combat-based video games, and post-traumatic stress disorder populate the Internet rabbit hole of further research on Grossman’s ideas about desensitization and conditioned  killing. Book pages and charts embedded directly into the wall are drawn from the chapter "From A Distance You Don't Look Anything Like a Friend" which outlines the psychological relationship between physical distance and <a href="failedstates.html">the resistance to kill.</a>
