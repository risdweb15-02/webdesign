				<p class="title">Big U</p>

				<p>When you look at the map of Manhattan, historically, since the 17th century, we’ve been creating more and more landfill. We made it, so we have to protect it. You need more than eight contiguous miles of flood protection. Can we make this flood protection without creating a wall that segregates the life of the city from the water around it? Learning from the High Line, can we imagine that the infrastructure for flooding could be combined with different programs?</p>

				<p>We thought this project that we call the Big U—or the Dry Line—could be the love child of Jane Jacobs and Robert Moses. Our idea is that you have this big U [wrapping around the bottom half of Manhattan] that’s compartmentalized just like a hull of a ship. You have narrow zones where you can protect one neighborhood at a time, and we got funding for the first compartment, on the Lower East Side. On the one hand, it has to resist the massive scale of an incoming flood, but it has to happen rooted in the demands and the dreams of the local community. We spent the last year working with people on the Lower East Side to provide input for what this could be like.</p>
