				<p class="name">Typeface as Program</p>

				<p>In 2009 the École Cantonal d’Art de Lausanne (ÉCAL) published Typeface As Program, a book which originated in the efforts of its graphic design programme to teach type design as a separate discipline. The book summarises a series of workshops, including workshops on the technical processes of type creation, and includes a comprehensive essay by Jürg Lehni on the nature of digital type design and <a href="../project-2-hyperlinked-artist/lego.html">font software</a>. The print run was limited, and as is generally the case with books published (and subsidised) for specific occasions, Typeface As Program has long been sold out and will not be reprinted.</p>
