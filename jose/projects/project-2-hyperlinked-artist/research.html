				<p class="name">Research Notes</p>

				<p>Research Notes attempts to celebrate how we find ourselves doodling while on the phone, testing pens in stationery shops, our belief in folklore, the need to misuse technology or whose idea it was to fly aero planes in formation to write messages across our skies.</p>

				<p>Selected from the shared archive A Recent History Of Writing and Drawing, the book provides references to things old, new and maybe forgotten which together can offer an alternative understanding of our habit <a href="../project-2-hyperlinked-artist/rita.html">to document and communicate thoughts and ideas</a>.</p>

				<p>Upending assumptions that any one kind of communication is more authentic, more direct or more valid that any other, meaning, texture and poetry is found in the most unlikely places.</p>
