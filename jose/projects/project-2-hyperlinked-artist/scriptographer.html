				<p class="name">Scriptographer</p>

				<p>Scriptographer’s strength lies in the encouragement of a symbiotic relationship between an existing tool for computer assisted manual creation and the benefits of formulating bespoke processes in code.</p>

  				<p>Using Scriptographer, the user is no longer limited to the same standardised tools provided by closed software. The scripting environment allows the creation of <a href="../project-2-hyperlinked-artist/paper.html">mouse-controlled drawing tools</a> , effects that modify existing graphics, as well as scripts that create new ones.</p>

  				<p>Unfortunately, the launch of CS6 brought too many changes in the underlying APIs and has therefore set an end to the project.</p>

  				<p>But the effort lives on in Paper.js, created by Jürg Lehni and Jonathan Puckey as an open-source vector graphics programming framework that runs on top of open-web standards such as Canvas 2D and SVG, with the aim to broaden the reach of Scriptographer’s API and free it from the closed and expensive confines of Illustrator.</p>
