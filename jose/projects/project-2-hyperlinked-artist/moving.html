				<p class="name">Moving Picture Show</p>

				<p>In Moving Picture Show a scenario of production for <a href="../project-2-hyperlinked-artist/scriptographer.html">animated drawings and texts</a> is created by reappropriating a process normally used by the movie industry to etch subtitles into 35mm film.</p>

  				<p>A high-power laser is moved rapidly over the surface of the film, burning away the emulsion layer and leaving thin lines where only the clear base of the celluloid remains. When projected, these lines have a specific optical quality, appearing to float above the image.</p>

  				<p>The current migration from analogue to digital film projection in cinemas across the globe is quickly turning the medium of 35mm motion picture film into a niche product for enthusiasts and archival usage, rendering obsolete and for the first time making available most of the technical equipment used to produce, process and screen such films.</p>

  				<p>Changing the working range of the laser in addition to modifying, extending and partly replacing the software and hardware interfaces on such a machine leads to new possibilities: animations and full-frame drawings can be realised on top of film. The film can either consist of existing material, film created purely for this purpose, or black, non-developed film.</p>
