 		<p>Things to Say documents a series of collected drawings produced in collaboration with invited guests to perform with Viktor every Thursday evening throughout the duration of the exhibition A Recent History Of Writing And Drawing at the ICA in London in 2008.</p>

  		<p>The book was produced by replacing the blade in the vinyl cutter used in Empty Words with a felt-tip pen. A selection of the vector drawings originally executed by Viktor was then drawn, true to the scale of the chalk.</p>

  		<p>The resulting drawings were scanned and printed with white ink on black paper, to reference the original chalk drawings.</p>
